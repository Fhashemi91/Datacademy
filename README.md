# Datacademy

The Datacademy Bootcamp is brought to you by Datacation B.V. This repository contains all exercises to test your Data Science skills. As can be seen, the modules on the left side correspond to the theoretical part in Easy-LMS. After completing a theoretical part on Easy-LMS you will be asked to open the corresponding files in this repository. The first three exercise modules are written in Python Notebooks, which concern: M02: Python Crash Course (PCC); M03: Structured Query Language (SQL); M04: Machine Learning (ML). The structure of a Notebook lends itself to add tekst between code cells, which will guide you through the exercises.

The later modules will mostly be written in actual plain Python files. The reason for this being that some of the functionalities needed are not supported in Notebooks. However after already written some code we suspect that you will not face too much difficulties doing this. Besides, in practice most code you will find and work with will be in plain Python files, making it a good practice.

We wish you good luck, but above all a lot of fun, making your first steps of your data journey!

Best regards, Team Datacation.
